This project will pull transactions from your banks into CSV files and upload to your cloud storage.
Only Google Drive is supported at this time.

## Usage
You can run this code on your local machine or use GitHub Actions

### Local machine
You will need the following files in your working directory.
- `client_secrets.json`: This is the file you will download after setting up using **Google APIs Console**.
  See `PyDrive2` [documentation](https://docs.iterative.ai/PyDrive2/quickstart) to get this.

- `credentials.json`: This file is generated by running [this project]()
- `.env`: The `.env` file from [this project](https://github.com/omnicortex/teller)
- `tokens.csv`: This is the connections tokens from teller.io and it's generated by running [this project](https://github.com/omnicortex/teller)

- Download the `teller.zip` file from teller.io and extract it to `teller_zip`
- Create a folder named `export` if not yet exist.

Now run `teller2cloud.sh`

### GitHub Actions
You first need to fork this project. 
Go to your repo's **Actions** > Click **I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them**
Then create the following repository secrets for your workflow and place the content of the corresponding file from above in it. Go to your repo's **Settings > Secrets** and add a **New Secret**.

- `ENV`: The `.env` file
- `TOKENS`: The `tokens.csv` file
- `GDRIVE_CLIENT_SECRETS`: The `client_secrets.json` file
- `GDRIVE_CREDENTIALS`: The `credentials.json` file
- `TELLER_CERTIFICATE`: The `certificate.pem` file in your `teller_zip` folder
- `TELLER_PRIVATE_KEY`: The `private_key.pem` file in your `teller_zip` folder

In the **Actions** tab of your repo, the **Fetch** workflow will now update your transactions periodically. The default refresh interval is once a month â€“ you can use [Crontab Guru](https://crontab.guru/) to define your own interval.
